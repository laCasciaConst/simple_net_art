      <p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found and 404 (pronounced "four oh four") error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
        (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to
        communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

        The web site hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts to follow a
        broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide
        Web.</p>
      <p>When communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a web browser request for a
        web page, with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code)
        message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped Uniform Resource Locator
        (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is
        similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as FTP and NNTP.

        At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable "reason phrase". The HTTP specification
        suggests the phrase "Not Found" and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404
        code and the "Not Found" phrase.

        A 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ
        URL mapping or URL redirection by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most
        server configuration files, or through URL rewriting; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because
        these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.

        404 errors should not be confused with DNS errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that
        does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to
        retrieve the requested page.</p>
      <p>Web servers can typically be configured to display a customised 404 error page, including a more natural
        description, the parent site's branding, and sometimes a site map, a search form or 404 page widget. The
        protocol level phrase, which is hidden from the user, is rarely customized.

        Internet Explorer, however, will not display custom pages unless they are larger than 512 bytes, opting instead
        to display a "friendly" error page.[2] Google Chrome included similar functionality, where the 404 is replaced
        with alternative suggestions generated by Google algorithms, if the page is under 512 bytes in size.[citation
        needed]

        Another problem is that if the page does not provide a favicon, and a separate custom 404 page exists, extra
        traffic and longer loading times will be generated on every page view.

        Many organizations use 404 error pages as an opportunity to inject humor into what may otherwise be a serious
        website. For example, Metro UK shows a polar bear on a skateboard, and the web development agency Left Logic has
        a simple drawing program.

        While many websites send additional information in a 404 error message—such as a link to the homepage of a
        website or a search box—some also endeavor to find the correct web page the user wanted. Extensions are
        available for some popular content management systems (CMSs) to do this.

        In Europe, the NotFound project, created by multiple European organizations including Missing Children Europe
        and Child Focus, encourages site operators to add a snippet of code to serve customised 404 error pages.</p>
